Recently, the Spanish government defined a new law “Ley 28/2022, de 21 de diciembre, de fomento del ecosistema de las empresas emergentes“, also called “StartUps Law”, which was formally approved recently.

After this law was approved, new initiatives came along from different regions within Spain to attract people from other countries that could get profit from that law. One of those initiatives is the initiative called “Nomad Asturias“, which claims to be “a digital nomad paradise“.
